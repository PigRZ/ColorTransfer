function [U_t,A_t] = MatchColumns(us,ut,at)
% Ensures consistency between the target & source image rotation matrices.

% This routine matches columns in the target image rotation matrix to those
% in the source image rotation matrix.

% Each rotation matrix is derived by undertaking a singular value
% decomposition of the respective cross covariance matrices. The
% outcome of the decomposition is ordered within the rotation matrix in 
% the order of the descending singular values.  This often leads to 
% compatible rotation matrices but that is not guaranteed.  Sometimes the 
% colour ordering of one rotation matrix may be different from the other.
%
% Additionally even when the matrices do correspond in orientation, they
% need not correspond in direction. The direction axis rotation in one
% matrix may be the negative of the rotation in the other.

% Rotations of the individual colour axes are given by the columns of the
% rotation matrices.  In the following processing, all rearrangements are 
% considered of the columns in the target rotation matrix 'ut', to find 
% the arrangement that best matches the source rotation matrix 'us'. 
% Matching is measured by taking the vector dot products of the 
% corresponding matrix columns and finding the arrangement with the 
% largest sum of absolute dot product values.  Absolute values are used 
% to accommodate axis pairs that have similar orientations but different 
% directions.
%
% Once the best match has been found this is taken as the correct target
% image rotation matrix.  Columns are negated where the vector cross
% product has a negative value, to ensure direction compatibility.  The 
% singular value matrix for the target image is reordered to match the 
% reordering of the rotation matrix.

% All 6 permutations of the three columns need to be addressed.

    % Compute the sum of the absolute dot products for the matrix columns. 
    sum=abs(ut(:,perm(i,1)).'*us(:,1)) + ...
